Section 8 (1) of the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act, Act 85 of 1993.\nSafe work practices are types of administrative controls that include procedures for safe and proper work used to reduce the duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure to a hazard. Examples of safe work practices for SARS-CoV-2 include requiring regular hand washing or\nusing of alcohol-based hand rubs. Learners and teachers should always wash hands when they are visibly soiled and after removing any PPE. Keep safe distances and wear a mask at all times.",
